    <h4>Example Code?</h4>
    <p>It's easy to integrate MailChimp and Nexmo, and the <a href="https://github.com/Nexmo/Mailchimp">provided code</a> shows a very simple integration. It's not a ready-made solution, but an example and starting point to build whatever integration is needed.</p>
    <p>If you're a developer, <a href="https://github.com/Nexmo/Mailchimp">take a look at the code</a>. If you're not, you can find a <a href="">developer with Nexmo experience on oDesk</a>, and point them to this page.</p>
